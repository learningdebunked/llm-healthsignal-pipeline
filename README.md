# ü©∫ LLM Healthcare Pipeline (Beginner Friendly Guide)

Welcome to the **LLM Healthcare Pipeline** project! This guide is for **new developers**, **non-machine-learning engineers**, or anyone curious about how AI can help with health data like ECGs and EEGs.

## ü§ñ What This Project Does (In Simple Terms)

Imagine you have a machine that can:
- Read heart and brain signals (like ECG and EEG)
- Clean them up (remove noise)
- Break them into pieces
- Learn from them using a smart brain (AI)
- Then explain what it found in plain English using GPT-2

That's what this project does, step by step.

## üí° Technologies Used

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `wfdb` | Downloads ECG/EEG data from PhysioNet |
| `numpy` | Math with arrays (like Excel but for code) |
| `scipy` | Helps filter out noise from signals |
| `keras` / `tensorflow` | Trains and runs AI models (like LSTM) |
| `transformers` | Lets us use GPT-2 to write natural language |
| `flask` | Turns our code into a web app with buttons |
| `sklearn` | Helps prepare data and split it |

## üìÇ File Descriptions

### 1. `data_loader.py`
Loads health signal data and prepares it.

- `bandpass_filter()`: Removes noise from raw data
- `normalize()`: Scales values between -1 and 1 (helps model learn better)
- `load_physionet_dataset()`: Downloads and loads ECG/EEG signals
- `segment_signal_data()`: Breaks a long signal into smaller pieces

### 2. `model_train.py`
Trains an AI model (LSTM) using cleaned signal data.

- It loads multiple datasets (ECG, EEG, etc.)
- Cleans and splits the data
- Builds a neural network using Keras
- Trains it to classify heartbeats or sleep stages

### 3. `inference.py`
Uses the model to:
- Predict what's happening in a signal
- Explain it using GPT-2 (language model)
- Fill in missing signal data using GANs or diffusion

### 4. `api.py`
Runs a small web server with 3 buttons:
- `/dashboard`: a web page (UI not included)
- `/ask`: lets users ask questions (uses GPT-2 to answer)
- `/feedback`: saves user suggestions to a file

## üß† How It Works Step-by-Step

1. **Download data** from PhysioNet using `wfdb`
2. **Filter noise** using a bandpass filter
3. **Normalize** the values so they fit a consistent scale
4. **Split the signal** into chunks of 3000 units
5. **Label each chunk** with what it represents (like "AFib" or "REM sleep")
6. **Feed it into an LSTM model**
7. **Train** that model to predict future data
8. **Use GPT-2** to explain the predictions in English
9. **Provide a web API** to interact with this pipeline

## üìä Supported Datasets

This project supports 6 real medical datasets from [https://physionet.org](https://physionet.org):

- MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset
- PTB Diagnostic ECG Database
- PTB-XL (Extended ECG)
- Chapman-Shaoxing ECG
- MIMIC-III ICU Waveforms
- Sleep-EDF (for EEG sleep signals)

## üîå How to Run It

1. ‚úÖ Install Python 3
2. ‚úÖ Open terminal and clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/llm-healthcare-pipeline.git
cd llm-healthcare-pipeline
```
3. ‚úÖ Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. ‚úÖ Run the web app:
```bash
python api.py
```

Then go to: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## üß™ Try This

### Example prompt:
```json
POST /ask
{
  "prompt": "Explain this ECG result: Atrial Fibrillation"
}
```

You‚Äôll get a response like:
```
"Atrial Fibrillation is a common irregular heartbeat..."
```
